## Project Overview
CardioPredict is a machine learning project aimed at predicting cardiovascular health outcomes. By leveraging predictive models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to enhance healthcare outcomes.

## Data Preparation
The first step in the project involved cleaning and organizing the dataset. This included:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
2. **Data Transformation**: Normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

## Model Development
Two predictive models were developed in this project:
1. **Random Forest**:
   - Utilized an ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
   - Tuned hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Employed a simple yet effective linear model to estimate the probability of cardiovascular outcomes.
   - Regularized the model to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.

## Results
The models achieved high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting cardiovascular health outcomes. Key performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
To use the CardioPredict models, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardiopredict.git
   cd cardiopredict
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data**:
   Place your dataset in the `data/` directory and run the data preparation script:
   ```bash
   python data_preparation.py
   ```

4. **Train the Models**:
   Train the Random Forest and Logistic Regression models using:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Models**:
   Evaluate the performance of the models on the test set:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_models.py
   ```
